# Ford GoBike Bike Sharing System Exploration
## by Mwezi Chipeta


## Dataset

> The dataset I'll be investigating will be based on individual rides system in the greater San Francisco Bay area in February 2019.The goal is to clean and prepare this data set to make visualizations and communicate the important findings in a report and presentation. The monthly statistics are provided by Bay Wheels and these can be viewed on their website https://www.lyft.com/bikes/bay-wheels/system-data.

## Summary of Findings

> The male gender was the most popular with significantly more than half the users of Ford GoBike compared to females and other.

> The majority of users using Ford GoBike are subscribers.

> There are not a lot of individuals who utilise the Bike Share System in San Francisco Bay Area.

> The busiest day of the week is Thursday followed by Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday then Monday; Saturday and Sunday have the same amount of trips done

> Most trips were taken at 17 hours, followed by 08 hours; The least trips were taken between 03 hours and 04 hours.

> Most trips were less than 30 minutes.

> There were outliers when it came to age and duration_min. These were explored and as only certain parts of the variables were being inspected, the outliers were ignored.

> Customers utilise their bikes more than subscribers as their trip duration is longer.

> The Other gender's average bike trip duration is more than that of female and male users

## Key Insights for Presentation

> Firstly, I introduced simple visualizations of the number users according to their gender and user type, and a distribution of their ages, then for the count of the trips in each day and in each hour. I mostly used Histograms, pie charts and bar charts for the univariate visualizations.

>After that, I focused on the findings of the relationship between a categorical and numerical variables which are: user types and age, and users' gender and age, to find their influence on their trip duration as well the day of the week and time of the day.
